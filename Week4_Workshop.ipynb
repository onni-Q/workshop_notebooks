        "In this workshop, we will continue examining hate-speech detection. As we have seen, our simple methods have failed to deliver convincing results using dictionaries. Transformers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)) are the foundation of some of the most popular AI applications like ChatGPT. Will they do better? Don't worry, it is not as complicated as it sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "With Transformers, machines can generate text, translate from one language to another, analyze comments, label words in sentences, etc. Transformers have been introduced in a paper called 'Attention is all you need' (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf). It has become one of the coining papers of the new AI age.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a lot of critical work on monopolization in the field of AI, with Open AI owned by Microsoft, who also owns the Cloud infrastructures to run ChatGPT applications, etc. One attempt to work against this is to create open-source versions of deep-learning architectures and models. A leading organisation in this field of open-source AI is Hugging Face, which provides a wide range of models for text analysis or so-called language models (https://huggingface.co/). They make interacting with Transformers quite easy, as you will find out by the end of this workshop. In many ways, the Hugging Face way of doing NLP is easier than what you have seen in the lecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this workshop, you will understand the Hugging Face ecosystem, before you learn how to fine-tune a Transformers model. Then at the end, we find out how easy it all is by using Hugging Face directly without any further training.  The last part 'Tour of Transformer Applications' (zero-shot) shows the breadth of what is possible but you can be selective in what you actually run. If time is tight, you can at first ignore the Case Study on classifying patents.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can do all the things we introduced in the lecture easier (and often much better) with Transformers from classification to information extraction. Before we reach the easy things, we need to, however, first understand more about the Hugging Face ecosystem. It allows you to load datasets of texts and transform them so that they can be used in deep learning. To this end, it introduces much more efficient tokenizers than we have already seen. Most importantly, Hugging Face's models help us reuse the knowledge stored in other language models. This process is called fine-tuning and means that we can take an existing language model and adjust it to our work. For instance, we could pick up the 'BERT' language model based on the original Transformers paper and fine-tune it so that it would be able to recognize sentiments in the state of the unions.\n",

        "We will employ Transformers to predict whether an input text is hate speech or not based on examples we will train a model with. Thus, while in the lecture we used unsupervised learning with dictionaries to detect hate speech, we now employ supervised learning. This requires training datasets that are labelled, which we can also get from Kaggle and Hugging Face. To make it more interesting, we switch to more relevant data for this kind of work and look at hate speech in Tweets and social media.\n",

        "In this case, we can see that the dataset is heavily imbalanced. We could try and find more hateful Tweet examples, but we skip this here. Instead let's look how long the Tweets are. This is important for several reasons. We have already discussed the impact of text lengths in the lecture but for language models there is also an important additional reason. Transformer models have a maximum input sequence length that is referred to as the _maximum context size_. This is what they can see from a text at any particular moment in time, because of the way that they have been trained.\n",

According to this documentation, its maximum context size is 512 tokens, which amounts to a few paragraphs of text. This should be fine for Tweets but let's check. Complete the cell below to visualise the Tweet lengths."

At the beginning, it is probably a good idea not to go beyond 128 and if you have problems use 64 or 32 as batch size. You computer will complain a lot if you get the batch size wrong. Thus, if you see strange memory errors, a good idea is always to first reduce the batch size. This generally leads to longer processing times though, because fewer records are processed at the same pass. `epochs` are the number of passes through the network. The larger the number of epochs the higher the chances for the network to learn, but it also takes much longer. For demonstration purposes, we set `epochs = 2`.

        "Congratulations, you now know how to train a Transformer model to classify Tweets. This can only be the beginning but hopefully you found it interesting. The most important lesson to remember are the processing steps from the Hugging Face figure above, which are very standard and repeat themselves. The steps are also repeated in the first chapter of the Transformers book with some added extra explanations: _Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, Thomas Wolf (2022): Natural Language Processing with Transformers, O'Reilly Media, Inc. While inspired by the book, we have changed the datasets, adjusted the task and removed some additional content. But the book is a great introduction to NLP with Transformers written by the Hugging Face team. It is, however, quickly getting outdated by changes to the Hugging Face libraries.\n",

        "Does this look scary? Maybe, but it is actually always the same steps. Why not ask Gemini whether it can do. This time, do not use a code cell directly but click on Gemini symbol. A chat interface opens. Ask Gemini to \"classify from ds the label from tweet using HuggingFace's DestilBERT\". It should print out the same steps we have just gone through and create the code for you. I just had to make a few simple adjustments."

        "The next example is taken from another wonderful resource: the FastAI training course. The patents' case study repeats once more the steps how to use Transformers for text analysis. The corresponding book is _@Howard, J. and Gugger, S. (2020): Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and Pytorch: AI Applications Without a PhD, O'Reilly Media, Inc._ It is open access at https://www.fast.ai/.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a look at their example for text classification, which introduces another twist showcasing the power of language models. Before this new twist, many NLP tasks were tackled with specialized models, as we have seen. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Classification tasks (like sentiment analysis) used models that output class labels.\n",
        "- Translation models outputted target-language sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we can use only LLMs, their training procedure and code, for a wide range of NLP problems by simply saying that all these different things can be mapped towards text-to-text input-outputs. Check out this famous paper that summarises the idea: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.\n",

        "## Case Study: Text Classification Patents\n",
        "\n",
        "In my research, I have used text analysis extensively to analyse Tweets. But I have also been interested in patents to understand corporate practices in relation to deep learning, which has inspired me to this case study. We will analyse the Kaggle U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching competition from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/. It is described as matching different phrases:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"In this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims \"television set\" and a prior publication describes \"TV set\", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a \"strong material\" and another uses \"steel\", that may also be a match. What counts as a \"strong material\" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn't want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, we want to compare two words or short phrases in order to score them whether they are similar or not in a particular context, based on which patent class they were used in. With a score of 1, the two inputs are considered to have identical meaning, while 0 means that they have totally different meaning. 'Abatement' (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/abatement) and 'eliminating process', e.g., have a score of 0.5, meaning they are somewhat similar but not identical. I have to trust that this is right, as they are specific patent ideas with their own meanings, which I know very little about. You will meet a couple of these in this case study.\n",

        "\n",
        "The library `opendatasets` takes care of all the issues with downloading datasets from online sources with authentication. Uncommenting the line `od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/uspppm-data')` and running it, might prompt you for your username and password to access Kaggle. You also need a so-called API key, which can be difficult to find (https://christianjmills.com/posts/kaggle-obtain-api-key-tutorial/). They will be covered again later in the course. If you have problems, come and talk to us.\n",

Wie bei jeder Wahl wird es eine Zeit für die Menschen sein, über den Zustand unserer Union und die Arbeit derer nachzudenken, die sie vertreten. Aber es wird auch eine Zeit sein, darüber zu entscheiden, welche Art von Zukunft und welche Art von Europa sie wollen. Unter ihnen werden Millionen von Erstwählern sein, von denen die Jüngste 2008 geboren wurden. Da sie in diesem Wahlstand stehen, werden sie darüber nachdenken, was ihnen wichtig ist. Sie werden über den Krieg nachdenken, der an unseren Grenzen wütet. Oder über die Auswirkungen des zerstörerischen Klimawandels. Darüber, wie künstliche Intelligenz ihr Leben beeinflussen wird. Oder über ihre Chancen, in den kommenden Jahren ein Haus oder einen Job zu bekommen. Unsere Union spiegelt heute die Vision derer wider, die von einer besseren Zukunft nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg träumten. Eine Zukunft, in der eine Union der Nationen, Demokratien und Menschen zusammen arbeiten würde, um Frieden und Wohlstand zu teilen. Sie glaubten, dass Europa die Antwort auf den Ruf der Geschichte war.\n"
